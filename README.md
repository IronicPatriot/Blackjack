Blackjack Python App

TLDR - a recreation of Blackjack in Python.

The App features random hands for the player and dealer with both competing to get the closest to 21 without going over. 
The first card the dealer gets is facedown and revealed later, alot of Blackjack games online omit this. 
Once the player stays or goes bust the dealer reveals his facedown card and gives himself cards until he has 17 or greater.

**Why?**
The project started out as a text-based Python game as a way to play with Python's random function. 
After completeing this version I decided to build a GUI around the same code using Tkinter.

**Version 2.0**
In the future I would like to add animations of the cards being dealt out and add token chips to simulate betting. 

**Installing**
Requires Python 3 or greater installed to run. After that simply run the script and enjoy.
